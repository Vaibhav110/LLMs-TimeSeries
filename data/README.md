The dataset is downloaded from the UCI website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality

The data is only for research purpose

The data is modified to internpolate all the NA (represented by -200) values.
That data is later processed in 4 days each, which each sample will be transformed into a image.

Image conversion code is present in the software directory
